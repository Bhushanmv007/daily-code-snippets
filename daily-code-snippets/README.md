# Daily Code Snippets
Welcome to the Daily Code Snippets repository! ðŸš€

This repository is dedicated to maintaining a daily habit of coding by contributing small, yet meaningful code snippets. Each snippet is designed to tackle a particular problem, explore a programming concept, or experiment with a new technique. The goal is to improve coding skills, explore different languages, and maintain a green contribution graph on GitHub.

## ðŸŒŸ Goals
* Consistency: Commit a new code snippet every day to keep the GitHub contribution graph green.
* Learning: Explore different programming languages and solve small coding challenges.
* Sharing: Provide a useful repository of code snippets that others can learn from or use in their projects.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Feel free to browse through the snippets in the snippets/ directory. Each file is named with the date it was created, followed by the language or topic. For example, 2024-08-10_snippet.py contains a Python snippet created on August 10, 2024.

## How to Use
* Clone the Repository:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/bhushanmv007/daily-code-snippets.git 
```
